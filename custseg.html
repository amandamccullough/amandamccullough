  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Data from a UK-based online store contains 20 months of customer transactions. With over 4000 customers and thousands of products, it is vital that the store uses efficient marketing strategies to maximize profits. The purpose of this analysis is to compare customer segmentation and ad recommendation algorithms for the most accurate product targeting practices. In doing so, customers will be recommended the products they are most likely to purchase, reducing unnecessary advertisement costs and increasing sales.</p>
