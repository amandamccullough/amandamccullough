  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>As a dedicated student pursuing a BS/MS in Applied Statistics with a secondary major in Economics, I am equipped with a strong analytical skill set and a commitment to excellence. With a background in fast-paced retail environments and a consistently strong course load, I work diligently and efficiently in high-stress environments. I am excited to continue to learn and grow in every role I take part in.
  
  I use this site as a method of storing and showcasing my work as a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as my own personal research and projects.
