  <h2><a href=custseg.html>Customer Segmentation for UK-Based Online Store</a></h2>
  <p>Data from a UK-based online store contains 20 months of customer transactions. With over 4000 customers and thousands of products, it is vital that the store uses efficient marketing strategies to maximize profits. This project aims to comopare customer and product segmentation strategies for accuracy, efficiency, and adaptibility. </p>
  <p>The data for this project was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data">Kaggle.</a></p>

  <h2><a href=grocery.html>Grocery Nutrition, Cost, and Usage Optimization</a></h2>
  <p>With increasing grocery cost and health concerns in the United States, affordable nutrition is vital to preserve the physical and financial health of Americans. In implementing an algorithm to parse through grocery cataloges and recipes from around the world, a machine learning algorithm has been created to optimize nutritional variety and intake while reducing food waste. This algorithm takes into account historical data and preferences, using ingredients from user's pantries and taking into account expiration dates.</p>

  <p>The data for this project was entirely self-collected. </p>
